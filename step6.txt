STEP 6: debug the wordlist crate and switch to the wordle wordlist.

The wordlist crate uses the code generation configuration facilities of Alire.
In this step we will use these to debug the crate and switch the wordlist.

TODO: open the manifest of the wordlist crate, found at
  ./wordlist_ada/alire/cache/pins/wordlist/alire.toml

Observe the [configuration.variables] section, where two variables are defined.
One of those is for logging, the other is to select the wordlist. You may also
see step 7 at the end of this file, but **don't start with it yet**.

TODO: enable logging of the crate. Todo so, edit the alire.toml **of the
wordle_ada** folder (that is, the one we have at the top of the working tree)
to override the value of the Logging variable. To do so, add:

[configuration.values]
wordlist.Logging = true

to the alire.toml at `wordle_ada/alire.toml`

TODO: build everything with `alr build` run in the wordle_ada folder.

TODO: locate with your editor the `wordlist_config.ads` file, and verify that
the Logging variable has the expected value. Check how the enum for the
available wordlists is also there.

TODO: `alr run` and observe a new message before the game starts, such as:

    Loading words from /path/to/wordlist.json
    Loaded 370105 words 

TODO: continue in step 7, found at the end of the 'wordlist' crate manifest, at
  ./wordlist_ada/alire/cache/pins/wordlist/alire.toml
